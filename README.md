Problem Statement

A client from company needs a simple personal calendar system for his employees to use personally or also for work. Currently, they do not have a calendar system in place that allows employees to schedule and manage events. They greatly need a software system to serve as a calendar to schedule any events or meetings they might have. In addition, the manager would like the ability to schedule an event or meeting based on the availability of all the employees. It takes too much time right now to find the best time for everyone in the team to meet so having a system that finds the best time for each individual would save a lot of time and allow everyone to focus on their tasks.

System Proposal
A software system to help the company with the desired functionality of the system.
The software system will be a simple calendar system for personal use.  The system shall provide the following services to a user:
- Sign in & sign out of the system
- Add an event to the calendar, including conflict check of two events.
- Delete an event from the calendar.
- Edit an event on the calendar.
- View an event.
- View a monthly-based event list.
